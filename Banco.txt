-- Just watch me, moving far away
-- Nobody even knows my name, and
-- No one suspects that I'm not fine, and
-- Nobody outs behavial Frankestein.

-- Just look at Vicktor in L.A,
-- And Sid in the Y at U of A
-- And all the majors at the lab
-- Reboot as soon as I am able,

-- Every other day I'm wondering,
-- What's a human being got to be like?
-- What's a way to just be competent?
-- These sweet instincts, ruin my life.

-- Every other day I'm wondering,
-- Was it a mistake to try and define?
-- What I'm certain's mad incompetence?
-- These sweet insticts, ruin my life.

-- "Imposter Syndrome" - Sidney Gish
